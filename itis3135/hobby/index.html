            <p>
                I have been playing video games since I was a child.
                It became a hobby for my when I first played Sly Cooper on the PlayStation 2 and
                some Harry Potter game on PC that I can't remember the name of.
                Since then, I have enjoyed a variety of games across different genres 
                and platforms. Gaming has provided me with countless hours of entertainment,
                social interaction, and even opportunities to learn new skills.

                The best time to play video games is when it fits naturally

                on weekends during free time provides a relaxing way to unwind 
                and have fun. Ultimately, the ideal gaming time depends on personal 
                schedules and balance‚Äîensuring it remains an enjoyable and healthy
